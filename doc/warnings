1) Upgrade ruby from 1.9.3 to 2.0.0 not possible, cause we have no possibility to access to encrypted fields,
for example @letter.subject:

ActionView::Template::Error (no implicit conversion of Symbol into String):
    16:     <% @letters.each do |letter| %>
    17:       <tr>
    18:         <td><%= letter.id %></td>
    19:         <td><%= link_to letter.subject, letter_path(letter) %></td>

2) It's impossible to uprade to rails 3.2.13, cause rails 3.2.13 depend on mail 2.5.3, but last work version
of mail is 2.4.4. New one have a problem with tls connection:

SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv2/v3 read server hello A: unknown protocol
